# Week Six | Thinking In Paper

## Paper Prototypes
![](gif.gif)

This week we worked on a new way to think about how to code through paper prototypes! It was a method of visualising how a project would function by creating a simple sketch or verbally speaking about its interactivity. We were asked to pick a classic arcade game to recreate per group and ours did [Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)) designed by Ed Logg and Lyle Rains. The game had a very simple architecture and a few actions that would create reactions. One example being when the player shoots, the asteroid breaks into multiple pieces. Andy then suggested that we attempt to combine or add to our paper prototype demonstrating how easy it was to make changes.

I came up with the idea of adding pong to asteroids aka “Pongstroids” -@HamishPayne, which would turn the single player PVE game into a multiplayer PVP where the second player would attempt to either bounce asteroids towards the ship or allow them to pass onto the other side of the screen. These changes were done simply by adding two rectangles to each side of the canvas.

## Brief 3 | Picking a Text

We then confirmed the texts would be basing our final assignment on. For myself I chose the text Viruses Are Good for You by [Julian Dibbell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Dibbell). This read was interesting read as it shed light on how people viewed Viruses as these unknown and alien like code and that not knowing what it they are capable of doing was scary for most people. Unlike a biological virus, these viruses are products of humans through culture, so it begs the question of why they scare us and feel so unhuman? I will continue to read through Dibbell’s article for ideas and themes in which I will translate to a paper prototype for my final brief.
