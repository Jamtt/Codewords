# Welcome to Codewords ðŸ‘‹

The place where Coding and Literature become one.

##### SKO Statement
This is a Studio Knowledge Object for the class CodeWords (led by Karen ann Donnachie and Andy Simionato) and is an archive of learnings/ findings, progress and experiences throughout the class. The goal of this documentation is to be able to showcase progress and reflect on how far the student has come throughout the 12 weeks. 
For myself, Itâ€™s been a journey of discovery through electronic literature and a testament on how you can learn something and then apply It to a project. Electronic Literature has always fascinated me from my earliest encounter being the Library of Babel. The concept of â€˜generativeâ€™ literature and other digital influences has been explored within this class as Karen and Andy show us the endless possibilities that it holds when connected with something as intricate as code. The testament of learning p5js in this timeframe has definitely been a challenge but an enjoyable one to say the least. The endless possibilities and pathways not only within the code itself but they way you showcase a final project make for intuitive and brilliant outcomes as demonstrated by the class. It has a pleasurable experience to still be able to see live progress and grow alongside a group of students with these current times. So please feel free to visit any of the other students SKOâ€™s as they have all put effort and time into both creating their projects and documenting their progress. 

Finally a little bit about my own documentation. I personally am not a writer so you may have to excuse some casual phrasing and slang here and there. My intentions are to create a human like way of talking about my progress to contrast from the nature of coding language and its formalities. The structure has been organised in weeks of progress, each showcasing what has been done within that week either from class or personal researching and progress. The weeks are split into various topics explored and can contain various links and Images to external sources. At the bottom of each week there is navigation to either go to the previous or next week.
