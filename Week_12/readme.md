# Week 12 | Conclude
Time has passed so quickly that we are already in the last week of CodeWords! It’s a bit crazy looking back on these 12 weeks and seeing how much code I’ve learnt. Now I just have to retain it and keep on learning (more reflection in a bit).

## Some last-minute adjustments
Adding in responsive ratios was important to me for this project as I felt that if this view was shared it would most likely be opened in a range of different screen widths. Adjusting various things like input and reply locations and sizes all needed to be adjusted for the screen sizes. For most of these I used a else if statement to check the windowWidth size and that would match the different screen sizes. 

I also worked a lot on the RiveScript side of dialogue by create more of a structure/ pathway on how the user travels through the narrative.  Here’s a little breakdown on how the user would go though the sketch. (This is done through using topics on Rivescript to lock the user to a certain area of the script).

## Class Presentations
During this session of class we worked on creating some assets for our sketches to be uploaded to an archive website of all our sketches in one place. Karen was live coding whilst Andy was helping out with submission questions and creating web friendly gifs and Images. Once everything was done we went through all the sketches of the class and everyone did a mini presentation on their work. It was so great to see all the progress come together into these beautiful sketches and I am very proud of what our class has been able to achieve.

## Some things I could have done better

Looking back on this sketch project as a whole, I think there were lots of changes to my concept that ultimately hindered the result of my progress. There were points were I was possibly reaching too far with our timeframe and others where I could have thought about it a bit more. For example, RiveScript was one that could have been more carefully considered as the more I worked with it, the more I realised the limitations it had. Towards the end It felt like a had dug myself into a hole a little. 

Improving on the flow and dialogue is also something that could have been heavily improved on as there are no clear instructions on how to progress through the narrative. The concept is based on my interpretation on how a human would react talking to a AI but in fact, with some testing I found a lot of my friends just enjoyed typing in random letters to attempt to break the AI. (How rather interesting). So this sketch could have done with more testing and more dialogue to combat this random anomalies. 

Things I would have done differently would probably be looking more into different alternatives for AI chatbots and possibly implementing more user interaction then just the textbox. Sometimes for the longer paragraphs where the user is reading what the AI is saying, it can be difficult to be patient and not just spam enter to skip dialogue. Nevertheless I think it still came out alright but I’m always looking for ways to improve something. 


## Reflection
So this is it. CodeWords comes to an end but the things we’ve learnt live on! I’ve always wanted to learn coding and to be able to create things that I have in my head is a new skill that I’ve developed. But as much as skills are useful, the way of thinking about the relationship of Code and Words is something that will always be of interest. I think starting this class off with the interpretation of text within a virtual space was one of my favourite activities done at Uni. It’s something that you wouldn’t expect and was so fun to just take a space that was created for gaming and make something unique out of it. You can see the playlist of them [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiOQQN-uh4c&list=PLUcOibqqi1kyBP6b0wt7EsPpsiJ-UzEaH).

Further in we began learning to code in p5js which I had the tiniest bit of experience from the CTRL+ project Aaron and I worked on. Learning more of its capabilities in this class unlocked the potential for how far you could go with creating things on the web. I see a lot of potential with mixing HTML CSS and P5js together to create some interesting sites that both function well and are unique in interactivity. As we mixed p5js with text it also began to spawn different ways of reading/interpreting digital literature that I had never really considered. This area felt like a mix of designing for the user experience aswell as for the actual text and I think that’s something new that could be further explored. 

This will also be my last studio that I officially attend at university and I chuckle when looking back, Karen and Andy were my first studio coming into this course. Its been a pleasure to be a part of this class and even more being once again taught by the wonderful duo. I can 100% say with confidence that these two studio leds teach with their students wellbeing and growth first and believe in their students abilities and capabilities. The introduction to coding is a path that I really would love to continue to explore outside of university and I am grateful that I have had the opportunity to learn from them. 

To Karen and Andy, best wishes to the future and I hope that you continue to teach and influence these young designers.
