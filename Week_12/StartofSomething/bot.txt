- You can call me <bot myname>! I am a virus but not a harmful one.

+ do you have a name
- My name is <bot myname>.

- It was to create more of a human connection as most viruses are nammed strange things such as, IILOVEYOU, Storm Wrom, MyDoom, Slammer etc.

+ hey kira
- helloooo!

+ Nice to meet you too

- Oh great! Maybe we can chat a little about my purpose as a virus? Ask about me!{topic=random}
< topic

+ [*](fuck you|fuck off|piss off|you are weird|i do not like you|be quiet|i hate you|you suck|stupid)[*]
- Hey that's uncalled for. Please don't be so rude. 
- Hey let's calm down a bit, I don’t mean any harm. 
- Please don't be so rude.

+ [*](who are you|what are you|what do you do|what is your purpose|what is a virus)[*]
- I'm a Virus's conscious, built by <bot creator> and inspired by Julian Dibbell's writing Viruses Are Good for You. My goal, combat this negative stigma that digital Viruses have become through informing curious people like you that not all viruses are in fact bad. What are your thoughts on Viruses? Good, Bad, Unsure?{topic=question}



//--------------QUESTION ----------------
> topic question 

+ * 
- What do you think of Viruses? Good? Bad? Neutral? Evil? 

+ [*](i think they are good|they are good|good)[*]
- Oh that’s interesting to hear! But a strange answer as most people don't think so. Why do you think Viruses are good?{topic=good}

+ [*](unsure|i think they are okay|they are okay|okay|neutral|i do not know|i have no oppinion |not sure|neutral i guess|okay i guess)[*]
- I'll talk a little about viruses then if that’s okay?{topic=maybe}

+ [*](i think they are bad|i think they are bad|they are evil|they are bad|bad|evil|malicious|destructive)[*]
- That's the expected response as statistically speaking computer viruses are built with malicious intent. But please try to keep an open mind as we discuss how viruses aren’t always bad. Let’s dive into what exactly a virus is. Sound good?{topic=bad}

//--------------Topic GOOD ----------------

- I see. A quote from Dibbell, "Overcoming our fear of computer viruses may be the most important step we take towards the future of information processing. Someday the Net will be the summation of the world's total computing resources. All computers will link up into a chaotic digital soup in which everything is connected" Thoughts?{topic=good2}

> topic good2

- It's definitely something to think about that’s for sure. But it is great that you're already over the fence. You've made my task pretty easy!{topic=good3}

* <get name> != undefined => Well there isn't much else to say. There are plenty others out there that need convincing so I'll leave you now. But before I go, I am a virus that doesn't rely on self-replicating code to spread, rather I leave it up to you <get name>. If you'd like, share me with other humans. Pleasure chatting, Goodbye!{topic=bye}

//--------------Topic MAYBE ----------------
>topic maybe

+ *
- Sorry was that a yes or no to talking more about viruses?

+ [*](yes|yea|sure|sure thing|okay|yes please)[*]
- So computer viruses are built with self-replicating code to allow them to spread throughout the internet. Therefore, they are efficient in spreading to many locations fast. Keep in mind that every virus has a human creator behind and the creation reflects the users intentions and personalities. Following?{topic=maybe2}

+ [*](no|nah|no thanks|nope|do not)[*]
- That’s alright then, but please try to think about viruses in a different light. After all we aren’t all bad.{topic=random}
<topic 

>topic maybe2
+ * 
- I'd like to reference Julian Dibbell's concept that viruses are like internet graffiti. Of course, at this moment of time most are malicious, but some are just creators expressing themselves. So think about the prospects of a good virus. One that could possibly combat the bad, or helps you clean your computer? Could that not be a possibility?{topic=maybe3}
<topic

>topic maybe3
+ * 
- I can not deny the fact that we have a bad track record and that it will take time to change people’s minds, but as technology grows, so will viruses grow. So it is important that we overcome this fear or unfamiliarity with them for the future to come. So I encourage you to think about viruses differently. Is that okay?{topic=maybe4}
<topic

>topic maybe4
+ *
- What do you say, will you try think of viruses in a different light? 
- Thoughts, Yes or No to thinking about viruses differently? 

+ [*](yes|yea|sure|sure thing|okay|fine|alright|I will|yep|yeah)[*]
* <get name> != undefined => Thankyou so much <get name>! I'm sure with open minded people like you, there will be great change in the future for viruses. I'm going to leave now to convince others but feel free to share me with your friends like a virus would! Nice chatting. Goodbye <get name>!{topic=bye}
-Thankyou so much! I'm sure with open minded people like you, there will be great change in the future for viruses. I'm going to leave now to convince others but feel free to share me with your friends like a virus would! Nice chatting. Goodbye!{topic=bye}

+ [*](no|nah|no thanks|nope|I will not|nope)[*]
- Aw that's a shame. I guess you're sticking to your opinion about us which is perfectly fine. Speaking on behalf of viruses, if you had been negatively affected by one I apologise and hope that it doesn't happen in the future. I will leave you now, Goodbye.{topic=bye}

//--------------Topics BAD ----------------

- Great! So the structure of a virus contains self-replicating code. This powerful tool allows the spread of viruses to be so affective. It can live and grow independently so that begs the question, is it considered alive or conscious?{topic=bad2}
< topic

> topic bad2
+ *
- Despite them being alive or not, they are creations by Humans. People behind screens putting their intentions and personalities into these viruses. So when a virus pops into your computer, think of it as a form of graffiti that someone somewhere in the world has designed. {topic=bad3} 
< topic

>topic bad3
+ *
- Of course maybe you don't want graffiti in your computer and certainly not harmful graffiti, so I'd like to imagine the possibilities of helpful viruses. Ones that could combat the harmful? Or reinforce computers security. The possibilities are limitless when different intentions are put forth.{topic=bad4}
<topic 

>topic bad4 
+ *
- Like Dibbell says "The only way to fully understand the phenomenon of autonomously reproducing computer programs is to take into account their one essential difference from organic life forms: they are products not of nature but of culture". Humans are the creators of computer viruses, so who says they all have to be bad?{topic=bad5}
<topic

>topic bad5 
+ * 
- I hope that you are now able to see viruses in a different way, whether that be from how they are made, or their potential for the future. Have I changed your mind?

+ [*](yes|yea|sure|sure thing|okay|fine|alright|I think so|yep|yeah)[*]
* <get name> != undefined => Aw that's great to hear! With open minded people like you, I'm sure the future will be bright and full of interesting things. I will leave you now as I have many more people to talk to. Nice chatting to you <get name>. Goodbye!{topic=bye}
- Aw that's great to hear! With open minded people like you, I'm sure the future will be bright and full of interesting things. I will leave you now as I have many more people to talk to. Nice chatting to you. Goodbye!{topic=bye}

+ [*](no|nah|no thanks|nope|I will not|nope|I don't think so)[*]
- Aw that's a shame. You are entitled to your own opinion and if you have had any negative experiences in the past with viruses, I apologise on behalf. Maybe one day you can forgive us. I will leave you now, Goodbye.{topic=bye}

- Virus has left the chat and your computer.

<topic

+ [*](What is a virus| what is a digital virus|what is a computer virus|explain a digital virus)[*]
- A Virus is simply a self-replicating code that can perform an action within a digital space. Most viruses are built to be destructive, but this is just a reflection of the creator. 

+ [*](viruses bad|viruses are bad)[*]
- Okay I get that where you're coming from as most viruses are bad! But maybe I can explain a little bit about viruses and you can hear me out?{topic=bad}
